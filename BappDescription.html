<p>This extension enables Pcap and Pcap-NG files to be imported into the Burp Target site
map, and passively scanned. It can be used in cases
where an HTTP client does not support proxying but it would be useful to scan, inspect or replay the HTTP traffic using Burp.</p>

<p>After installation, an "Open Pcap file..." option will be added to the context menu on the tree under the Target tab.</p>
